We are interested in mechanics of slender structures and their applications in metamaterials and metastructures with innovative functions, including tunable mechanical properties, such as stress-strain relation, energy absorption and vibration isolation; as well as programmable robotic behaviours, such as shape-morphing, mechanical sensing, actuation, memory and computation. We aim to design and analyse such kind of intelligent systems by harnessing mechanics theory, numerical simulations and physical experiments.

The Principal Investigator
======
Dr. Mingchao Liu (刘明超) is currently an Assistant Professor at [University of Birmingham](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx) and holding a concurrent appointment as a [Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/research/research-careers/presidential-postdoctoral-fellowship-(ppf)) at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) in Singapore. Before that he was a [Newton International Fellow](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/newton-international/) at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, sponsored by the Royal Society from 2018 to 2021. He graduated from Tsinghua University in 2018 with a PhD in Engineering from the Department of Engineering Mechanics. During his Ph.D study, he spent six months in 2017 as a visiting research fellow at the University of Sydney under the support of the Endeavour Research Fellowship. Prior to this, He received his B.S. in Engineering Mechanics from Shandong University in 2013.
