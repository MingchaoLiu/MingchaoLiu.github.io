We are interested in mechanics of slender structures and their applications in metamaterials and metastructures with innovative functions, including tunable mechanical properties, such as stress-strain relation, energy absorption and vibration isolation; as well as programmable robotic behaviours, such as shape-morphing, mechanical sensing, actuation, memory and computation. We aim to design and analyse such kind of intelligent systems by harnessing mechanics theory, numerical simulations and physical experiments.
